<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Sharefile API for NodeJS. Basic read/download functionality is implemented at the moment, more to come...

## Testing

To run tests, copy the folder /test-data/secrets.sample to /test-data/secrets and fill the API data in auth.ts.

You will also need to upload the following 3 files to your sharefile account, inside the '/Personal Folders/LibTest' folder:

- ./tests/files/LargeFile.xlsx to /Personal Folders/LibTest/LargeFile.xlsx
- ./tests/files/EmptyFile.txt to /Personal Folders/LibTest/EmptyFile.txt
- ./tests/files/SmallFile.txt to /Personal Folders/LibTest/SmallFile.txt
